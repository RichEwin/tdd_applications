# Calculator

## Approach

I have been approached to build an app that provides four calculate functions; addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 5, 5  | 10     |
| 5, 5  | 0      |
| 5, 5  | 25     |
| 5, 5  | 1      |

## Tech

The application is built in Ruby, using Test-Driven Development.

## How to run

- Fork and clone this repo to your chosen folder
- Terminal: Run `bundle install`to install dependencies
- Terminal: Run `irb -r './lib/calculator.rb'`
- Terminal: Run `rspec` to run unit tests
